2019-09-28 12:22 @work today I've been working with Oscar to rectify the issue where I submit far too many CRs.
In particular, we are working on making sure I don't do too many revisions.

##Things I learned
* At Amazon there are multiple reviewers on a given CR, so it's better to wait for the full feedback cycle before submitting more confusing CRs

##To work on
* Analyzing my own code (Be Right, a Lot) (Vocally Self-critical)
* Working longer hours (Dive Deep)
* Focus

##Trying
* Pomodoro

##Highlights
* I am taking more of a leadership role in the Outposts project, creating common functions and helping people when they need it
* By far I have the most CRs, demonstrating bias for action

2019-10-10 16:58 @work I am still struggling to stay focused, although the Pomodoro technique etc is helping out.
In particular, I don't really know what to do during the off times, although it seems watching videos and looking at outstanding tasks is a good idea.
I am also continuing to struggle with the CR process. It seems that even thouhgh I am attempting to pay more attention, style issues are especially bad.
I need to continue to seek out more opportunities to lead, especially when it comes to helping others and being a better communicator. This may also help my issue with CRs, if I start looking at things through other people's eyes. Taking this extra step will simultaneously save me boredom in the short run and give me time in the long run, as well as will build rapport.
