2019-09-28 12:22 @work today I've been working with Oscar to rectify the issue where I submit far too many CRs.
In particular, we are working on making sure I don't do too many revisions. 

##Things I learned
* At Amazon there are multiple reviewers on a given CR, so it's better to wait for the full feedback cycle before submitting more confusing CRs

##To work on
* Analyzing my own code (Be Right, a Lot) (Vocally Self-critical)
* Working longer hours (Dive Deep)
* Focus

##Trying
* Pomodoro

##Highlights
* I am taking more of a leadership role in the Outposts project, creating common functions and helping people when they need it
* By far I have the most CRs, demonstrating bias for action
